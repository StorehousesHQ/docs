## What is the Estate Manager Portal?

The Estate Manager Portal is Storehouses' enterprise solution for professional asset managers. It enables estate planning firms, wealth management companies, law firms, and family offices to manage their clients' alternative asset portfolios from a centralized dashboard.

## Enterprise Plans

Storehouses offers two enterprise-level plans:

### Enterprise Plan

For professional firms who manage client portfolios.

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Pricing** | Per-seat subscription |
| **Portal Access** | Full Estate Manager Portal |
| **Team Management** | Roles, permissions, client assignments |
| **Audit Logging** | Complete activity trail |
| **Firm Notes** | Private notes on client items |
| **Client Capacity** | Unlimited clients |

### Managed Pro

Clients whose assets are managed by an Enterprise firm receive automatic Pro-tier access at no additional cost.

<Note>
  When a firm establishes a relationship with a client, that client's subscription is automatically upgraded to Pro. The client pays nothing—their Pro access is covered by the firm relationship.
</Note>

## How It Works

| Layer | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Firm** | Your organization (estate planning company, law firm, family office) |
| **Seats** | Team members within the firm (Owner, Admin, Manager, Viewer roles) |
| **Relationship** | Connection between firm and client with defined permissions |
| **Client** | Storehouses user who granted access to view their portfolio |

The flow works like this:

1. A **firm** creates an account and adds **seats** for team members
2. The firm requests access to a **client**, or the client invites the firm
3. A **relationship** is established with specific permissions
4. Firm users can now access client data (items, collections, locations, etc.) based on their role and permissions

### Key Concepts

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Firms" icon="building">
    A firm represents your organization—the estate planning company, law firm, or family office. Each firm has a unique lookup code (slug) that clients can use to find and invite you.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Seats" icon="chair">
    Seats are individual user accounts within a firm. Each employee who needs portal access requires a seat. Seats have different roles with varying levels of access.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Client Relationships" icon="handshake">
    A relationship is established when a client grants your firm access to their portfolio. Relationships define what permissions your firm has over the client's data.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Assignments" icon="user-check">
    For firms with multiple employees, assignments control which team members can access which clients. Admins can see all clients; managers and viewers only see their assigned clients.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
