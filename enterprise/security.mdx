## Overview

The Estate Manager Portal is built with security at its core. This document explains the security architecture, access controls, audit capabilities, and compliance features that protect client data.

## Security Architecture

### Defense in Depth

Every request to access client data passes through multiple security layers:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Identity Verification" icon="key">
    First, we confirm who you are:
    - Valid login credentials
    - Active session
    - Account in good standing
  </Step>
  <Step title="Access Authorization" icon="shield-check">
    Then, we verify you're allowed to access this data:
    - You belong to an active firm
    - Your firm has a relationship with this client
    - You're assigned to this client (if required by your role)
    - You have the specific permission needed
  </Step>
  <Step title="Data Protection" icon="database">
    Finally, the database enforces its own rules:
    - Each table has access policies
    - All data is encrypted
    - Actions are logged
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  This multi-layer verification happens on every request. Even if someone gains unauthorized access to a session, they cannot access data they're not permitted to see.
</Note>

## Audit Logging

### Comprehensive Activity Tracking

Every action in the portal is logged:

| Action Category | Examples |
|-----------------|----------|
| **Authentication** | Login, logout, session refresh |
| **Data Views** | Dashboard access, item views, collection views |
| **Data Modifications** | Item create/edit/delete, collection changes |
| **Exports** | PDF generation, CSV downloads, print actions |
| **Administrative** | Permission changes, team changes, assignments |
| **Firm Notes** | Note creation, edits, deletions |

### What's Recorded

Each audit entry captures:

| Information | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Who** | The firm and specific user who performed the action |
| **What** | The action taken (viewed, edited, exported, etc.) |
| **When** | Precise timestamp of the action |
| **Where** | Which item, collection, or resource was affected |
| **Details** | Specific changes made (before and after values) |

### Tamper-Proof Records

Audit logs are protected by a cryptographic chain that makes tampering detectable:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="First Entry" icon="file-circle-check">
    Action recorded with unique fingerprint
  </Card>
  <Card title="Second Entry" icon="link">
    Links to first entry's fingerprint
  </Card>
  <Card title="Third Entry" icon="link">
    Links to second entry's fingerprint
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Each entry contains a cryptographic fingerprint of the previous entry. If anyone attempts to modify or delete a record, the chain breaks—making the tampering immediately obvious. This ensures a trustworthy, permanent record of all activity.

### Audit Log Access

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="For Firms">
    Firms can view their own activity logs:
    - All actions taken by their team members
    - Filtered by client, user, date range, or action type
    - Export audit logs for compliance reporting

    **Cannot see**:
    - Activity from other firms
    - Client's personal account activity
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="For Clients">
    Clients can view all firm activity on their account:
    - Every action from every connected firm
    - Complete audit trail of all data access
    - Export activity reports

    **Can see**:
    - Which firm user performed each action
    - Exact timestamp
    - What was accessed or changed
    - Export activity
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Data Isolation

### Firm-to-Firm Isolation

Firms cannot see:
- Other firms connected to the same client
- Activity from other firms
- Notes from other firms
- Any data about other firms' existence

### Client Data Boundaries

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Accessible with Permission" icon="check">
    - Items (with View Items)
    - Valuations (with View Valuations)
    - Collections (with Manage Collections)
    - Locations (with Manage Locations)
    - Heirs (with View Heirs/Manage Heirs)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Never Accessible" icon="xmark">
    - Client login credentials
    - Client billing information
    - Client's other share links
    - Client's other firm relationships
    - Client's personal notifications
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Permission Security

### Permission Verification

Permissions are verified at every level of the system:

1. **Before you see it**: The interface only shows actions you're permitted to take
2. **When you request it**: Every action is checked against your permissions
3. **At the data level**: The database independently enforces access rules

### Permission Escalation Prevention

- Permissions can only be modified by the client
- Firms cannot request permission upgrades through the portal
- Permission changes are logged
- Clients are notified of permission changes

### Sensitive Permissions

Some permissions require additional verification:

| Permission | Additional Requirements |
|------------|------------------------|
| Manage Heirs | Legal verification documentation |
| Export Data | Client notification on each export |

## Compliance Features

## Incident Response

### If You Suspect Unauthorized Access

**For Firms**:
1. Review recent audit logs
2. Verify all team member accounts
3. Remove any suspicious seats
4. Contact Storehouses support
5. Notify affected clients if confirmed

**For Clients**:
1. Revoke access from suspicious firms
2. Review audit logs for unauthorized activity
3. Change your account password
4. Contact Storehouses support
5. Document the timeline of events

### Reporting Security Issues

To report security vulnerabilities or incidents:
- Email: security@storehouses.app
- Include: Description, steps to reproduce, impact assessment
- Do not publicly disclose until resolved

## Data Retention

| Data Type | Retention Period |
|-----------|------------------|
| Audit logs | Indefinite (never deleted) |
| Active relationships | Until revoked |
| Revoked relationships | 90 days after revocation |
| Firm notes | Until firm deletes or relationship ends |
| User sessions | 24 hours of inactivity |

## Encryption

All data is protected with industry-standard encryption:

| What | Protection |
|------|------------|
| Data sent over the internet | Encrypted in transit (same security as online banking) |
| Data stored in our database | Encrypted at rest |
| Passwords | Securely hashed (we never store actual passwords) |
| Login sessions | Cryptographically signed tokens |
| Audit logs | Tamper-evident cryptographic chain |

## Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can firms see deleted data?" icon="trash">
    No. When items or other data are deleted, they are removed from the database. Firms cannot view deleted data. However, the audit log records that a deletion occurred.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can firms access data after revocation?" icon="ban">
    No. When a client revokes access, the firm immediately loses all access to client data. Our security controls prevent any data retrieval after revocation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Are audit logs truly tamper-proof?" icon="link">
    The cryptographic chain makes tampering detectable. Any modification to an entry breaks the chain, creating an obvious discrepancy. While no system is 100% tamper-proof, altering our audit logs would require extraordinary effort and would leave forensic evidence.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can Storehouses staff access my data?" icon="building">
    Storehouses staff do not have routine access to client data. Administrative access requires documented justification and is logged. We never share data with third parties except as required by law.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if a firm account is compromised?" icon="shield-exclamation">
    If you suspect a firm account is compromised, immediately revoke their access. This cuts off their ability to view your data. Review your audit logs to understand what was accessed.
  </Accordion>
