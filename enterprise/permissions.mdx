## Overview

The Estate Manager Portal uses a granular permission system to control what firms can do with client data. Permissions are set at the **firm-client relationship** level, meaning they apply to all users within a firm who have access to a particular client.

## Permission Model

Permissions are granted at the **firm-client relationship** level. When a client grants access to a firm, they choose which permissions to enable:

| Permission | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| View Items | See items in the portfolio |
| Edit Items | Create, update, and delete items |
| View Valuations | See prices and portfolio totals |
| Export Data | Download PDF/CSV reports |
| Manage Collections | Create and organize collections |
| Manage Locations | Manage storage locations |
| Manage Alerts | Set up price alerts |
| Manage Shares | Create share links |
| View Heirs | See heir designations |
| Manage Heirs | Modify heir settings (requires legal verification) |

### How Permissions Apply to Users

Firm users inherit relationship permissions based on their **role**:

| Role | Client Access | Can Edit | Can Export |
|------|---------------|:--------:|:----------:|
| **Owner** | All clients | Yes | Yes |
| **Admin** | All clients | Yes | Yes |
| **Manager** | Assigned only | Yes | Yes |
| **Viewer** | Assigned only | No | No |

<Note>
  Permissions define **what actions are allowed**. Roles define **who can perform those actions**. Both must align—a Viewer cannot edit even if the relationship allows editing.
</Note>

</Warning>

---

### Custom

**Best for**: Unique situations requiring specific permission combinations

When none of the presets fit your needs, you can toggle individual permissions to create a custom configuration.

## Role-Based Access Control

While permissions define what actions are allowed, roles determine who can access which clients within a firm.

### Firm Roles

| Role | Client Access | Portal Capabilities |
|------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Owner** | All clients | Full control: billing, settings, team management, delete firm |
| **Admin** | All clients | Team management, client assignments, all client operations |
| **Manager** | Assigned only | Full operations on assigned clients only |
| **Viewer** | Assigned only | Read-only on assigned clients only |

### Permission + Role Matrix

A firm user can only perform an action if:
1. The firm-client relationship has the required permission
2. The user has access to that client (based on role or assignment)
3. The user's role allows the action type

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Owner/Admin">
    **Access**: All clients automatically

    **Can perform**:
    - All actions permitted by relationship permissions
    - Team management
    - Client assignments (Admin only)
    - Billing and settings (Owner only)
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Manager">
    **Access**: Assigned clients only

    **Can perform**:
    - All actions permitted by relationship permissions
    - Add firm notes
    - Export data (if permitted)

    **Cannot perform**:
    - Team management
    - Client assignments
    - Access unassigned clients
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Viewer">
    **Access**: Assigned clients only

    **Can perform**:
    - View operations only (View Items, View Valuations, View Heirs)

    **Cannot perform**:
    - Any modifications (Edit Items, Manage permissions)
    - Export data
    - Add firm notes
    - Access unassigned clients
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Permission Inheritance

**Example scenario**: A firm-client relationship has these permissions:
- View Items: Granted
- Edit Items: Granted
- Export Data: Not granted

Here's what each role can actually do:

| Permission | Relationship | Admin | Manager (assigned) | Viewer (assigned) |
|------------|:------------:|:-----:|:------------------:|:-----------------:|
| View Items | Granted | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Edit Items | Granted | Yes | Yes | No (role restriction) |
| Export Data | Not granted | No | No | No |

<Note>
  The relationship permissions set the maximum allowed actions. A user's role may further restrict what they can do (e.g., Viewers cannot edit even if the relationship allows editing).
</Note>

## Changing Permissions

### Client-Initiated Changes

Clients can modify permissions at any time:

1. Go to **Account Settings → Estate Managers**
2. Find the firm and click **Edit Permissions**
3. Select a new preset or toggle individual permissions
4. Save changes

Changes take effect immediately. The firm is notified of permission changes.

### Requesting Additional Permissions

If a firm needs more permissions:

1. Firm contacts client directly
2. Client modifies permissions through their settings
3. New permissions become active immediately

<Note>
  Firms cannot request permission changes through the portal. All permission changes must be initiated by the client.
</Note>

## Audit Logging

Every action is logged with:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **timestamp** | Exact date and time (UTC) |
| **firm_id** | Which firm performed the action |
| **user_id** | Which specific user within the firm |
| **action** | The type of action (view, edit, export, etc.) |
| **resource** | What was accessed (item, collection, etc.) |
| **details** | Additional context (changes made, export format, etc.) |
| **hash** | Cryptographic hash linking to previous entry |

<Note>
  Audit logs are tamper-resistant and hash-chained. This means each entry contains a hash of the previous entry, making it impossible to modify or delete entries without detection.
</Note>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="For Clients" icon="user">
    - **Start restrictive**: Begin with View Only or Reporting Only, expand as needed
    - **Review regularly**: Check audit logs and adjust permissions if activity doesn't match expectations
    - **Use presets**: Presets are designed for common scenarios and tested for appropriate access
    - **Be cautious with manage_heirs**: Only grant to verified legal representatives
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="For Firms" icon="building">
    - **Request minimum necessary**: Only ask for permissions you actually need
    - **Explain your needs**: Help clients understand why you need specific permissions
    - **Respect boundaries**: Don't attempt actions outside your permitted scope
    - **Document access**: Use firm notes to record why you accessed or modified data
