## Managed Pro Benefits

When you're connected to an Enterprise firm, you automatically receive **Managed Pro** status:

| Feature | Free Plan | Managed Pro |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| **Items** | Up to 50 | Unlimited |
| **Collections** | 1 default | Unlimited |
| **Price Alerts** | Not available | Full access |
| **Heir Access** | Not available | Full access |
| **Share Links** | Not available | Full access |
| **Export Options** | Limited | Full PDF/CSV |

<Note>
  Managed Pro is provided at no cost to you—it's covered by your relationship with the firm. If the firm relationship ends, your account reverts to your previous subscription tier.
</Note>

## Granting Firm Access

There are two ways to connect with a firm:

### Option A: Approve a Firm's Request

If a firm has requested access to your portfolio:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Your Email">
    You'll receive an email notification when a firm requests access
  </Step>
  <Step title="Go to Account Settings">
    Navigate to Account Settings → Estate Managers
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review the Request">
    See the firm's name and the access they're requesting
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customize Permissions">
    Adjust the permission preset or individual permissions as needed
  </Step>
  <Step title="Approve or Deny">
    Click "Approve" to grant access or "Deny" to reject the request
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Option B: Invite a Firm

If you want to proactively invite a firm:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get the Firm's Lookup Code">
    Ask your estate manager or advisor for their firm's lookup code (slug)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Go to Estate Managers">
    Navigate to Account Settings → Estate Managers
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click 'Invite a Firm'">
    Enter the firm's lookup code
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Permissions">
    Select a permission preset or customize individual permissions
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send Invitation">
    The firm receives notification and can accept your invitation
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  You can find your advisor's lookup code on their website, business card, or by asking them directly. It's usually based on their firm name (e.g., `smith-estate-planning`).
</Tip>

## Understanding Permissions

When you grant firm access, you control exactly what they can do with your data.

### Permission Presets

For convenience, choose from these predefined permission sets:

| Preset | Best For | What They Can Do |
|--------|----------|------------------|
| **View Only** | Initial reviews, read-only access | View items and collections only |
| **Reporting Only** | Insurance, tax reporting | View items + export data to PDF/CSV |
| **Standard Management** | Most advisory relationships | View, edit items, manage collections and locations |
| **Full Management** | Comprehensive portfolio management | Everything except heir management |
| **Legal Representative** | Estate attorneys, executors | Full access including heir management (requires legal verification) |

### Individual Permissions

You can also customize permissions individually:

## Managing Firm Relationships

### Viewing Connected Firms

Go to **Account Settings → Estate Managers** to see all firms with access to your account:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Firm Name** | The organization's name |
| **Status** | Active, Pending, or Revoked |
| **Permissions** | Summary of granted permissions |
| **Connected Since** | When the relationship was established |
| **Actions** | Edit permissions or revoke access |

### Editing Permissions

You can change permissions at any time:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find the Firm">
    Go to Account Settings → Estate Managers
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click 'Edit Permissions'">
    Open the permissions editor for that firm
  </Step>
  <Step title="Adjust Settings">
    Change the preset or toggle individual permissions
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Changes">
    New permissions take effect immediately
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Permission changes are logged and the firm is notified when their access level changes.
</Note>

### Revoking Access

If you no longer want a firm to access your portfolio:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Estate Managers">
    Navigate to Account Settings → Estate Managers
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find the Firm">
    Locate the firm you want to disconnect
  </Step>

  <Step title="Access Removed">
    The firm immediately loses access to your data
  </Step>
</Steps>

  Revoking access is immediate. The firm will no longer be able to see any of your data. If you revoke access from all firms, your Managed Pro status will end and your account will revert to your previous subscription tier.
</Warning>

## Privacy Considerations

### What Firms Can See

Based on the permissions you grant, firms may be able to see:
- Item details and images
- Valuations and prices
- Collections and organization
- Storage locations
- Heir designations (if permitted)

### What Firms Cannot See

Regardless of permissions, firms **never** have access to:
- Your login credentials
- Your billing information
- Your personal email content
- Other share links you've created
- Access to other firms you've connected with

### Firm Notes

Firms can add private notes to your items that you cannot see. These notes are for the firm's internal use only (documenting appraisals, action items, etc.). While you can't see the note content, you can see in the audit log when notes are added or modified.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I work with multiple firms?" icon="building">
    Yes, you can grant access to multiple firms simultaneously. Each firm relationship has its own permissions, and firms cannot see each other or each other's notes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if I revoke access?" icon="ban">
    The firm immediately loses all access to your data. Any firm notes they created remain in the system but are no longer accessible. If you later reconnect with the same firm, previous notes may become visible again.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can firms see my other advisors?" icon="users">
    No. Firms can only see their own relationship with you. They cannot see other firms you've connected with or any activity from those firms.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if a firm employee leaves?" icon="user-minus">
    The firm manages their own team members. When someone leaves the firm, the firm admin should remove their seat. This is why the audit log tracks individual users—you can see who specifically accessed your data.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I see what specific changes were made?" icon="clock-rotate-left">
    Yes. The audit log includes details about changes, including before and after values for edits. This gives you complete visibility into all modifications.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens to my Pro features if I disconnect?" icon="crown">
    If you disconnect from all Enterprise firms, your Managed Pro status ends and your account reverts to your previous subscription tier (Free, Pro, or Lifetime). You'll need to maintain your own subscription to keep Pro features.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I know a firm is legitimate?" icon="shield-check">
    Verify the firm through independent means before granting access. Check their website, contact information, and credentials. Storehouses does not verify or endorse any firm—the responsibility for due diligence is yours.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Security Tips

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Grant Minimum Necessary Access" icon="minimize">
    Start with the most restrictive permission preset that allows the firm to do their job. You can always expand permissions later if needed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Review Activity Regularly" icon="eye">
    Check the audit log periodically to ensure firm activity matches your expectations. Unusual activity should be investigated.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Remove Unused Access" icon="trash">
    If you're no longer working with a firm, revoke their access promptly. Don't leave permissions active "just in case."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Be Cautious with Heir Permissions" icon="users">
    Manage Heirs permission should only be granted to verified legal representatives. This permission allows modification of your heir designations.
  </Accordion>
