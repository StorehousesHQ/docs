## Understanding Value Calculations

### Precious Metals
```
Spot Value = Weight (oz) × Purity × Current Spot Price
Total Value = Spot Value + Premium/Collector Value (if set)
```

### Other Assets
```
Item Value = Market Value (if set)
  OR Insurance Value (if set)
  OR Purchase Price (if set)
  OR $0
```

<Tip>
  For the most accurate portfolio value, regularly update market values for non-precious metal assets.
