## Overview

Heir Access is a secure emergency access feature that allows you to designate trusted individuals who can access your portfolio in case of incapacitation or death. This ensures your valuable asset records aren't lost and your beneficiaries can access important information when needed.

<Warning>
**Dual Pro Subscription Required**: Both you (the account holder) AND your designated heirs must have active Pro or Lifetime subscriptions for Heir Access to work. Additionally, heirs must have existing Storehouses accounts.
</Warning>

## What is Heir Access?

Heir Access provides a secure mechanism for designated individuals to access your portfolio through two distinct paths:

1. **Heir-Initiated Request**: Heirs request access and a waiting period begins (14-90 days)
2. **Account Holder Pre-Approval**: You grant immediate access without a waiting period

This feature balances security with emergency access needs, ensuring your asset records can be recovered by trusted parties if you become unable to access your account.

    - Heirs cannot be added until they have an active account
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Both Users Active" icon="circle-check">
    - Account holder and heir must both have active accounts

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## How Heir Access Works

There are two paths to grant heir access:

### Path 1: Heir-Initiated Request (With Waiting Period)

This path includes built-in security waiting periods:

<Steps>
  <Step title="You Designate Heirs">
    Set up one or more trusted contacts with their email addresses
  </Step>

  <Step title="Heir Requests Access">
    When needed, the heir (who you've already designated) initiates an access request through [storehouses.app/heir-access/request](https://storehouses.app/heir-access/request)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Waiting Period Begins">
    A security waiting period starts (14-90 days, default: 30)
  </Step>

  <Step title="You're Notified">
    You receive immediate notification and reminders at days 7, 14, and 21
  </Step>

  <Step title="You Can Deny Request">
    If you're able, you can immediately deny the request with one click
  </Step>

  <Step title="Final Notice">
    You receive a final notification 24 hours before auto-approval
  </Step>

  <Step title="Access Granted (If Not Denied)">
    After the waiting period, if not denied, heir receives access for 180 days
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Path 2: Account Holder Pre-Approval (Immediate Access)

You can grant access immediately without a waiting period:

<Steps>
  <Step title="You Designate Heir">
    Add heir via [storehouses.app/heir-access](https://storehouses.app/heir-access)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click 'Grant Access Now'">
    Use the green "Grant Access Now" button next to the heir
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm Access">
    Confirm you want to grant immediate access for 180 days
  </Step>

  <Step title="Heir Receives Email">
    Heir is immediately notified and can access your portfolio
  </Step>

  <Step title="Access Active">
    Heir has access for 180 days from approval
  </Step>
</Steps>

3. View the Heir Access configuration page

### Adding a Designated Heir

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click '+ Add Heir'">

  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter Contact Information">
    Provide the heir's details:

  <Step title="Go to Heir Access Page">
    Navigate to [storehouses.app/heir-access](https://storehouses.app/heir-access)
  </Step>

    Confirm you want to grant immediate access for 180 days
  </Step>

  </Step>
</Steps>

### When to Use Pre-Approval

**Good use cases**:
- Planned estate planning activities
- Sharing access with a trusted family member for legitimate reasons
- Medical emergencies where you're still able to grant access
- Collaborative portfolio management with a spouse

**Not recommended for**:
- General emergency preparedness (use Path 1 instead)
- When you want the security of a waiting period
- Heirs you don't completely trust

## Permission Levels

### Read-Only Access

**What heirs can do**:
- View all items in the portfolio
- See item details, descriptions, and notes
- View uploaded images and documents
- Access category-specific metadata
- View current portfolio value and pricing
- View purchase prices and market values
- See collections and their contents
- View storage locations
- Export portfolio to PDF
- Export data to CSV
- Generate printed reports

**What heirs CANNOT do**:
- Add, edit, or delete items
- Modify account settings
- Change email or password
- Access billing information
- Set up or modify alerts
- Delete the account
- Modify collections or locations
- Create new share links
- Invite other users
- Change their permission level

### Can Edit Access

**Everything from Read-Only, PLUS**:
- Add new items to your portfolio
- Edit existing item details
- Delete items
- Create new collections
- Modify existing collections
- Update item locations
- Change item valuations
- Upload images and documents

<Warning>
  Only grant "Can Edit" permissions to heirs you absolutely trust. They will have nearly full control over your portfolio data (except account settings and billing).
</Warning>

## Access Duration

Once granted (either path), heir access remains active until:

- **180 days pass** (automatic expiration)
- **You revoke it manually**
- **You delete your account**
- **You remove the heir**
- **Either user downgrades from Pro** (access automatically revoked)

<Note>
  Access automatically expires after 180 days to prevent indefinite access. Heirs can request renewal if still needed by submitting a new access request.
</Note>

## How Heirs View Your Portfolio

Once an heir has been granted access, they can view your portfolio directly from their Collections page:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Heir Logs In">
    The heir logs into their own Storehouses account
  </Step>

  <Step title="Navigate to Collections">
    Go to the Collections page via the sidebar
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Portfolio Tab">
    At the top of the Collections page, they'll see tabs for:
    - Their own portfolio
    - Each heir portfolio they have access to (showing account holder's name)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Browse Portfolio">
    Click a tab to view that portfolio's collections and items
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  The URL updates to include a query parameter when viewing heir portfolios: `/collections?portfolio=<requestId>`. Heirs can bookmark this URL for quick access.
</Note>

### What Heirs See

When viewing your portfolio, heirs have access to:

- **Dashboard view** with portfolio statistics
- **All items** with full details, images, and metadata
- **Collections** and their organization
- **Locations** where items are stored
- **Secure Storage documents** marked "Share with heirs" (if you've enabled this)

If you granted **Can Edit** permission, they can also add, edit, and delete items.

## Revoking Access

### Revoking a Pending Request

During the waiting period (Path 1):

**Option 1: Email Link**
1. Click "Deny Access" in any notification email
2. Confirm denial

**Option 2: Dashboard**
1. Go to Heir Access settings
2. Find the pending request (yellow "Pending" badge)
3. Click "Deny Request"
4. Confirm denial

### Revoking Granted Access

If an heir already has active access:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Heir Access Settings">
    Navigate to [storehouses.app/heir-access](https://storehouses.app/heir-access)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find Heir with Active Access">
    Look for green "Access Granted" badge
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click 'Revoke Access'">
    Click the red "Revoke Access" button
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm Revocation">
    Confirm you want to revoke access
  </Step>

  <Step title="Access Immediately Revoked">
    Heir loses portfolio access instantly and receives notification
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Revoking access doesn't remove the heir designation. They remain in your heirs list and can request access again in the future (Path 1) or you can grant immediate access (Path 2).
</Note>

## Email Notifications

Heir Access uses automated emails sent from `heirs@storehouses.app`:

### For Account Holders

1. **Heir Request Initial Email**: Sent immediately when heir requests access
2. **Heir Request Reminder (Day 7)**: First reminder during waiting period
3. **Heir Request Reminder (Day 14)**: Second reminder during waiting period
4. **Heir Request Reminder (Day 21)**: Third reminder during waiting period
5. **Heir Request Final Notice**: Sent 24 hours before auto-approval
6. **Access Granted Notification**: Sent when access is auto-approved

All emails include:
- Heir's name and email
- Days remaining (for pending requests)
- One-click "Deny Access" link
- Link to manage heirs

### For Heirs

1. **Request Confirmation**: Sent when they submit an access request
2. **Access Granted Email**: Sent when access is approved (auto or manual)
3. **Access Pre-Approved Email**: Sent when account holder grants immediate access
4. **Access Denied Email**: Sent when request is denied
5. **Access Revoked Email**: Sent when you revoke their active access

## Cron Job Processing

Heir Access uses an automated background job to process requests:

**Endpoint**: `/api/cron/process-heir-requests`
**Schedule**: Every 6 hours (runs at 0:00, 6:00, 12:00, 18:00 UTC)
**Authentication**: Requires `CRON_SECRET` environment variable

**Functions**:
- Processes pending heir-initiated requests only (not pre-approved)
- Sends reminder emails at appropriate intervals
- Auto-approves requests after waiting period
- Sends access granted emails to heirs
- Marks expired requests (>180 days)
- Validates Pro subscriptions for both users
- Auto-revokes access if subscriptions lapse

<Note>
  Pre-approved access (Path 2) bypasses all cron job processing and grants immediate access.
</Note>

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why do heirs need their own Pro subscription?" icon="question">
    This dual-subscription requirement:
    - Prevents system abuse
    - Ensures serious, committed usage
    - Validates heir identity through paid account
    - Reduces frivolous or malicious access requests
    - Helps sustain the service for both users
