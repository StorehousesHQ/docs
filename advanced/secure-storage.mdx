## Sharing with Heirs

Documents marked "Share with heirs" are automatically visible to heirs who have approved access to your portfolio.

### How It Works

1. **Upload or edit** a document
2. **Toggle on** "Share with heirs"
3. Document becomes visible to heirs with **approved access**
4. Heirs see the document in their view of your portfolio

### What Heirs Can Do

Heirs with access can:
- View shared documents
- Download shared documents
- See document metadata

Heirs **cannot**:
- Upload new documents
- Edit or delete documents
- Change sharing settings
- See documents not marked "Share with heirs"

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Upload Failed" icon="circle-xmark">

    **Solution**: Check file size and type, then retry
  </Accordion>

    - Clear folder filter (click "All Documents")
