## Overview

Share Links allow you to create secure URLs to share your portfolio with trusted individuals such as financial advisors, family members, insurance agents, or accountants. Each link can be customized with password protection, expiration dates, view limits, and editing permissions.

## What are Share Links?

Share Links generate unique, secure URLs that grant access to your portfolio data. Recipients don't need a Storehouses account to view shared portfolios. You maintain complete control over what's shared and can edit or revoke access at any time.

    Click the yellow "Create Share Link" button
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter Link Name">
    Provide a descriptive name (required) - e.g., "Financial Advisor Access" or "Insurance Appraisal 2026"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose What to Share">
    Select what to include in the share:
    - **Entire Portfolio** - Share all items across all collections

<Tip>
  Sharing specific collections is useful when you want to share only relevant items - for example, sharing your "Gold Bullion" collection with a precious metals dealer while keeping your wine collection private.
</Tip>

## Share Link Configuration

### Name Field (Required)

Every share link must have a name for easy identification:

- **Purpose**: Helps you distinguish between multiple links at a glance
- **Display**: Shows with avatar initials (first letters of each word)
  - Example: "My Portfolio Share" → "MP" avatar
- **Searchable**: Use the search box to quickly filter links by name

**Naming Best Practices**:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be Descriptive" icon="tag">
    **Good Examples**:
    - "Morgan Stanley Advisor - John Smith"
    - "Insurance Renewal 2026"
    - "Estate Attorney Review"
    - "Share with Spouse"

    **Poor Examples**:
    - "Link 1"
    - "Share"
    - "Temp"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Permission Settings

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Read-Only (Default)">
    Recipients can view all shared data but cannot make changes:

    **What recipients can do**:
    - View portfolio overview and statistics
    - Browse all shared items and collections
    - View item details, images, and metadata
    - Export data to PDF
    - Generate print-friendly views

    **What recipients cannot do**:
    - Add, edit, or delete items
    - Modify collections
    - Change account settings
    - Create new share links

    **Best for**:
    - Insurance agents
    - Appraisers
    - Accountants
    - Casual viewing
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Editable">
    Recipients can view and modify your shared items and collections:

    **Additional capabilities**:
    - Add new items to your portfolio
    - Edit existing item details
    - Delete items
    - Create and modify collections
    - Update valuations

    **Best for**:
    - Trusted family members managing joint portfolios
    - Professional portfolio managers
    - Collaborative collection tracking

    <Warning>
      Only grant edit access to people you fully trust. They will have full control over your shared portfolio data.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Expiration Settings

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Temporary Links">
    Links that automatically expire after a set date:

    **Use cases**:
    - One-time consultations
    - Temporary advisor access
    - Time-limited sharing
    - Enhanced security needs

    **How it works**:
    - Choose any future date
    - Link becomes inactive at midnight on that date
    - Recipients see an "expired" message after that date
    - You can extend expiration by editing the link

    ```
    Example: Share with appraiser for 7 days while evaluation is conducted
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Permanent Links">
    Links that remain active indefinitely until manually revoked:

    **Characteristics**:
    - No automatic expiration
    - Requires manual deletion to revoke
    - Link remains valid until you delete it
    - Data updates in real-time

    **Best for**:
    - Ongoing advisor relationships
    - Long-term family sharing
    - Regular insurance updates
    - Continuous collaboration

    ```
    Example: Share with financial advisor for ongoing portfolio management
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
  For security, use temporary links when possible. Only create permanent links for trusted, long-term relationships.
</Tip>

### View Limits

Control how many times a link can be accessed:

<ParamField path="Unlimited Views" type="default">
  Leave the "Max Views" field blank for unlimited access
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Limited Views" type="number">
  Set a specific number (e.g., 5, 10, 50) to restrict total views
</ParamField>

**How it works**:
- Each time someone opens the link, the view count increases
- Once the limit is reached, the link becomes inactive
- Current view count is displayed for each link
- You can increase the limit by editing the link

**Best for**:
- One-time consultations
- Preventing link sharing beyond intended recipient
- Limiting exposure of sensitive data

### Password Protection

Add an extra layer of security:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="When to Use Passwords" icon="lock">
    **Recommended for**:
    - High-value portfolios
    - Links sent via email or unsecured channels
    - Sharing with people you don't know well
    - Extra protection against link interception

    **Not necessary for**:
    - Links sent via secure channels
    - Very short expiration periods (24 hours)
    - Non-sensitive collections
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How Passwords Work" icon="key">
    - Recipients must enter the password to view the share
    - Passwords are encrypted using bcrypt hashing
    - You must send the password separately from the link
    - Password can be changed by editing the link
    - Leave password field blank when editing to keep existing password
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
