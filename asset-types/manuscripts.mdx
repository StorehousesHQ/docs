## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I identify a first edition?" icon="search">
    **First edition identification varies by publisher:**
    - **Number line:** Look for "1" in the number line (1 2 3 4 5...)
    - **Edition statement:** "First Edition" or "First Printing"
    - **Date matching:** Copyright date matches title page date
    - **Publisher indicators:** Each publisher has specific markers

    **Research resources:**
    - Publisher-specific guides
    - Bibliographic references
    - Collector forums and communities
    - Professional book dealers
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Should I clean or repair old books?" icon="spray-can">
    **Generally, no:**
    - Amateur repairs can decrease value
    - Cleaning can damage delicate materials
    - Original condition is preferred by collectors
    - Professional restoration for valuable items only

    **Exception:** Basic dusting with soft brush is acceptable

    <Warning>
      Never use household cleaners on books
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I value my rare books?" icon="dollar-sign">
    **Research market value:**
    1. Check recent auction results (Heritage, Christie's, Sotheby's)
    2. Search dealer catalogs (AbeBooks, Biblio)
    3. Consult price guides
    4. Get professional appraisal for high-value items

    **Factors affecting value:**
    - Edition and printing
    - Condition
    - Dust jacket presence
    - Signatures or inscriptions
    - Provenance

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What makes a signature valuable?" icon="signature">
