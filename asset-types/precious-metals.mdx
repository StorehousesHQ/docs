## Overview

Metals & Bullion is one of the most popular asset categories in Storehouses, offering automatic spot price valuation and real-time portfolio tracking for both precious metals and industrial metals.

<Tip>

</Tip>

## Supported Metals

Storehouses tracks both precious metals and industrial metals with automatic spot pricing.

### Precious Metals

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
  **Price Unit Difference**: Precious metals are priced per troy ounce, while industrial metals are priced per regular ounce. Storehouses automatically handles the conversion - all weights are stored in troy ounces for consistency. 1 troy oz = 1.09714 regular oz.
</Note>

## How Automatic Valuation Works

Precious metals in Storehouses use automatic spot price valuation:

```
Spot Value = Weight (troy oz) × Purity × Current Spot Price
Total Value = Spot Value + Premium Value (optional)
```

### Example Calculation

**1 oz American Gold Eagle:**
- Weight: 1.0 troy oz
- Purity: 0.9167 (22 karat)
- Spot price: $2,000/oz
- Premium value: $50

```
Spot Value = 1.0 × 0.9167 × $2,000 = $1,833.40
Total Value = $1,833.40 + $50 = $1,883.40
```

<Note>
  Spot prices are updated automatically from reliable market data providers. Your portfolio value updates in real-time as prices change.
</Note>

## Understanding Purity Formats

Precious metals purity can be expressed in different ways. Here's how to convert to Storehouses format:

### Fineness (.999, .9999)

Most common for bullion:
- .999 fine = 0.999 purity (99.9% pure)
- .9999 fine = 0.9999 purity (99.99% pure)
- .995 fine = 0.995 purity (99.5% pure)

**Enter directly as the decimal value**

### Karat (Gold)

Gold jewelry and some coins use karat:
- 24 karat = 1.0000 purity (100% gold)
- 22 karat = 0.9167 purity (91.67% gold)
- 18 karat = 0.750 purity (75% gold)
- 14 karat = 0.5833 purity (58.33% gold)

### Sterling (Silver)

- Sterling silver = 0.925 purity (92.5% silver)
- Coin silver = 0.900 purity (90% silver)

### Example 3: Canadian Maple Leaf (Mixed Sizes)

For multiple coins of different sizes, create separate entries:

**1/2 oz Maple Leaf:**
- Weight: 0.5
- Purity: 0.9999

**1/4 oz Maple Leaf:**
- Weight: 0.25
- Purity: 0.9999

<Tip>
  For multiple identical coins, use the "Quantity" field instead of creating separate entries
</Tip>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Always Record Exact Weight" icon="weight-scale">
    - Use troy ounces (not regular ounces)
    - Include fractional weights (0.5, 0.25, 0.1)
    - Verify weight on product documentation
    - 1 troy oz = 31.1035 grams
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Enter Accurate Purity" icon="certificate">
    - Check product specifications
    - Use decimal format (0.999, not 999)
    - Common purities: .9999, .999, .9167, .900
    - Purity affects spot value calculation
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Include Product Names" icon="tag">
    **Benefits:**
    - Easier identification for insurance
    - Helps determine premiums when selling
    - Useful for inventory tracking

    - "American Silver Eagle"
    - "10 oz PAMP Suisse Gold Bar"
    - "Canadian Maple Leaf 1 oz"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Track Premiums Separately" icon="dollar-sign">
    Use the premium_value field for:
    - Numismatic value (rare coins)
    - Collectible editions
    - Proof coins
    - Limited mintages
    - Special packaging (First Strike, etc.)

    This separates melt value from collector value
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Document Purchase Details" icon="receipt">
    Always record:
    - Purchase price (for cost basis)
    - Purchase date
    - Dealer/seller name

  <Accordion title="Photograph Your Metals" icon="camera">
    Take photos showing:
    - Front and back of coins
    - Packaging and certificates
    - Serial numbers on bars
    - Mint marks
    - Overall condition

    <Warning>
      Store photos securely - they contain valuable information
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Track Storage Locations" icon="vault">
    Use the location field to record:
    - Home safe
    - Bank safe deposit box
    - Third-party vault storage
    - Multiple locations for diversification

    Benefits:
    - Quick retrieval when needed
    - Insurance documentation
    - Estate planning
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Organize with Collections" icon="folder">
    Create collections for:
    - By metal type ("Gold Coins", "Silver Bars")
    - By purpose ("Long-term Hold", "Trading Stack")
    - By storage ("Home Safe", "Bank Vault")
    - By purchase year ("2024 Purchases")
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Understanding Spot Prices

### What Are Spot Prices?

Spot prices represent the current market price for immediate delivery of precious metals. Storehouses uses these prices to automatically value your holdings.

### Price Updates

<Card title="Automatic Updates" icon="arrows-rotate">
  - Spot prices update automatically throughout the trading day
  - Your portfolio value adjusts in real-time
  - No manual updates needed
  - Prices from reliable market data sources
</Card>

### Spot Price vs. Purchase Price

- **Spot value**: Current market value based on weight and purity
- **Purchase price**: What you actually paid
- **Premium**: Difference between purchase price and spot value at time of purchase

Track all three for complete records and to calculate gains/losses.

## Premium Tracking

### When to Use Premium Value

Use the `premium_value` field for:

1. **Numismatic coins** - Rare or collectible coins worth more than melt value
2. **Proof coins** - Special finish coins with collector premiums
3. **Low mintage** - Limited edition releases
4. **Graded coins** - Certified coins with premium grades
5. **Historical pieces** - Coins with historical significance

### Premium vs. Purchase Premium

**Premium Value (in Storehouses):**
- Current premium above spot for collector/numismatic value
- Updates separately from spot price
- Adds to total item value

**Purchase Premium:**
- What you paid over spot when buying
- Recorded in purchase price vs. spot value at purchase
- For reference/tax purposes

## Tax Considerations

<Note>
  Precious metals may have tax implications. Consult a tax professional for your situation.
</Note>

Track these fields for tax purposes:
- Purchase price (cost basis)
- Purchase date (holding period)
- Seller information
- Current market value (for reporting)

Storehouses helps you track this information but does not provide tax advice.

## Insurance and Estate Planning

### Insurance Documentation

Your precious metals records in Storehouses can serve as:
- Insurance inventory
- Proof of ownership
- Valuation documentation
- Purchase history

<Tip>
  Export your precious metals inventory regularly for insurance and estate planning purposes
</Tip>

### Heir Access

Consider using Storehouses' Heir Access feature (Pro) to provide:
- Emergency access for beneficiaries
- Complete inventory for estate settlement
- Purchase documentation
- Storage location information

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How often do spot prices update?" icon="clock">
    Spot prices update automatically throughout the trading day based on market data. Your portfolio value reflects current market prices in real-time.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I track numismatic coins?" icon="coins">
    Yes! Use the `premium_value` field to add numismatic or collector value above the spot (melt) value. This gives you total value = spot value + premium value.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What about 90% silver coins (junk silver)?" icon="coins">
    Track junk silver using:
    - Metal type: Silver
    - Purity: 0.900
    - Weight: Calculate total silver weight (face value × 0.715)

    Example: $10 face value = 7.15 troy oz, so enter 7.15 as weight
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Should I use quantity or separate entries?" icon="hashtag">
    **Use Quantity for:**
    - Identical coins/bars (same weight, purity, product)
    - Bulk purchases of same item

    **Use Separate Entries for:**
    - Different sizes (1 oz vs 1/2 oz)
    - Different products (Eagles vs Maple Leafs)
    - Different purchase dates/prices
    - Items you might sell individually
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I convert grams to troy ounces?" icon="calculator">
    Divide grams by 31.1035:

    - 31.1035 grams = 1 troy oz
    - 15.55 grams = 0.5 troy oz
    - 10 grams = 0.3215 troy oz
    - 100 grams = 3.215 troy oz
    - 1000 grams (1 kilo) = 32.15 troy oz
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if my coin has numismatic value?" icon="star">
    For coins worth more than melt value:
    1. Enter weight and purity for automatic spot calculation
    2. Add the numismatic premium in the `premium_value` field
    3. Total value = spot value + premium value

    This keeps melt and collector value separated.
