## The 4Cs of Gemstones

The four most important factors in gemstone valuation:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Carat Weight" icon="weight-scale">
    The weight of the gemstone measured in carats
    - 1 carat = 0.2 grams = 200 milligrams
    - Heavier stones are exponentially more valuable
  </Card>

  <Card title="Cut" icon="gem">
    The quality and style of how the stone is faceted
    - Affects brilliance and appearance
    - Cut grade and shape
  </Card>

  <Card title="Color" icon="palette">
    The hue, tone, and saturation of the gemstone
    - Most critical factor for colored stones
    - Graded on letter or descriptive scales
  </Card>

  <Card title="Clarity" icon="eye">
    The presence of internal inclusions or external blemishes
    - Flawless to Included grading scale
    - Affects transparency and value

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Always Get Certified" icon="certificate">
    **For valuable stones, certification is essential:**
    - Provides independent verification
    - Documents authenticity
    - Records treatments
    - Aids in insurance and resale
    - Protects against fraud

    **When to certify:**
    - Diamonds over 0.50ct
    - Any ruby, sapphire, emerald over 1.00ct
    - Expensive colored stones
    - Any stone over $1,000 value

    **Recommended labs:**
    - GIA (general, diamonds)
    - Gübelin (colored stones, prestigious)
    - SSEF (colored stones)
    - AGL (colored stones, U.S.)

    <Tip>
      For very valuable stones, get certification from top labs (GIA, Gübelin, SSEF)
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Document Everything" icon="file-text">
    **Maintain complete records:**
    - Original certificate/report
    - Purchase receipt
    - Seller information
    - Any appraisals
    - Treatment disclosure
    - Origin documentation

    **Upload to Storehouses:**
    - Certificate images (front and back)
    - Plotting diagram
    - Purchase documentation
    - Photos of the stone
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Photograph Properly" icon="camera">
    **Essential photos:**
    - Stone from multiple angles
    - In different lighting (daylight, indoor)
    - Close-up of any inclusions
    - Next to certificate for matching
    - On white background
    - With scale reference (ruler/coin)

    **Photography tips:**
    - Natural daylight best for color accuracy
    - Use macro mode for small stones
    - Clean stone before photographing
    - Show true color (no color correction)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Understand Treatments" icon="flask">
    **Common treatments and their impact:**

    **Acceptable/Standard:**
    - Heat treatment (ruby, sapphire) - minimal value impact
    - Minor oil (emerald) - standard practice
    - Irradiation (topaz, some quartz)

    **Moderate impact:**
    - Significant oil/resin (emerald) - reduces value
    - HPHT (diamond) - less valuable than natural color
    - Diffusion treatment - significantly less valuable

    **Major impact:**
    - Fracture filling (diamond) - much less valuable
    - Coating - temporary, low value
    - Undisclosed treatments - fraud

    <Warning>
      Always disclose treatments. Undisclosed treatments can void insurance and affect resale.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Store Safely" icon="vault">
    **Proper storage:**
    - Individual soft pouches or boxes
    - Separate from other gems (avoid scratching)
    - Cool, dry location
    - Away from direct sunlight (some gems fade)
    - In safe or secure location

    **Hardness considerations:**
    - Diamond (Mohs 10) can scratch everything
    - Corundum (ruby, sapphire, Mohs 9) can scratch most gems
    - Separate harder from softer stones

    <Tip>
      Store certificates separately from stones for security
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Regular Appraisals" icon="dollar-sign">
    **Update valuations periodically:**
    - Every 2-3 years for insurance
    - When market prices change significantly
    - After major market events
    - Before selling

    **Factors affecting value:**
    - Market demand trends
    - Origin discovery/depletion
    - New treatments or synthetics
    - Economic conditions
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Insurance Considerations" icon="shield">
    **Protect valuable gems:**
    - Specialized jewelry/gem insurance
    - Scheduled items on valuable articles policy
    - Keep certificates and appraisals updated
    - Document with photos

    **Insurance documentation:**
    - Certificate from recognized lab
    - Recent appraisal (within 2-3 years)
    - Purchase receipt
    - Photos
    - Storehouses export as backup

    <Note>
      Many insurers require certification from GIA, AGS, or similar for valuable stones
    </Note>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Understanding Gem Certificates

### What's Included in a Certificate

<Card title="Typical Certificate Contents" icon="file-certificate">
  **Identification:**
  - Certificate number
  - Date of issue
  - Stone type and variety

  **Measurements:**
  - Dimensions (length × width × depth)
  - Carat weight

  **The 4Cs:**
  - Cut (grade and shape)
  - Color (grade or description)
  - Clarity (grade)
  - Carat weight

  **Additional Information:**
  - Treatment disclosure
  - Origin (if determined)
  - Comments about the stone
  - Photo of the stone
  - Plotting diagram (showing inclusions)
</Card>

### Online Verification

Most major labs allow online verification:
- **GIA:** www.gia.edu/report-check
- **AGS:** verify on AGS website
- **IGI:** verify on IGI website

<Tip>
  Always verify certificate authenticity online before major purchases
</Tip>

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do I need a certificate for every gem?" icon="question">
    **Certification recommended for:**
    - Diamonds over 0.50ct
    - Valuable colored stones (ruby, sapphire, emerald) over 1ct
    - Any stone over $1,000-$2,000 value
    - Stones for insurance purposes
    - Investment-grade gems

    **May skip for:**
    - Very small stones (under 0.25ct)
    - Inexpensive semi-precious stones
    - Stones under $500-$1,000 value

    Certification costs $50-$300+ depending on lab and stone.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Natural vs. synthetic - how to tell?" icon="flask">
    **Lab-created (synthetic) gems:**
    - Have same physical properties as natural
    - Require testing to distinguish
    - Much less expensive than natural
    - Should be disclosed and certificated as such

    **Identification:**
    - Only gemologists with proper equipment can definitively test
    - Certificates will indicate "Laboratory-Grown" or "Synthetic"
    - Inclusions patterns differ

    <Warning>
      Always buy from reputable dealers who disclose synthetic/natural status
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What does 'eye-clean' mean?" icon="eye">
    **Eye-clean definition:**
    - No inclusions visible to naked eye (without magnification)
    - Typically VS2 or better for diamonds
    - Varies by gem type

    **Value impact:**
    - Eye-clean stones more valuable
    - For Type III gems (emerald), eye-clean is very rare/valuable
    - For Type I gems (aquamarine), eye-clean is expected

    <Note>
      For most gems, eye-clean clarity offers best value - looks clean but costs less than flawless
    </Note>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do treatments affect value?" icon="dollar-sign">
    **Treatment value impacts:**

    **Minimal impact (accepted):**
    - Heat treatment: 0-10% value reduction
    - Minor oil (emerald): Expected/standard

    **Moderate impact:**
    - Moderate/significant oil: 20-40% reduction
    - HPHT diamond: 20-30% less than natural color

    **Significant impact:**
    - Diffusion: 50-70% reduction
    - Fracture filling: 60-80% reduction
    - Coating: 70-90% reduction

    **Untreated premium:**
    - Unheated ruby/sapphire: 20-50% premium
    - Unheated, fine origin: 50-200%+ premium
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Should I track mounted or unmounted separately?" icon="ring">
    **Track separately:**
    - **Loose gems:** Use "Gemstones (Gems)" category
    - **Mounted gems:** Use "Fine Jewelry" category

    **Benefits:**
    - Different valuation methods
    - Different insurance needs
    - Clear inventory separation
    - Better for estate planning

    **Exception:** If you have the certification for the center stone in jewelry, you can note it in the jewelry item's description.
