    - Front/obverse

    - Hallmarks, signatures, or maker's marks
    - Serial numbers or certifications
    - Any damage or unique characteristics

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Privacy Consideration">

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Bulk Editing

Update multiple items at once:

- **Tags** - Apply tags to multiple items
- **Insurance Value** - Update insurance values by percentage or amount

<Tip>
Bulk editing is perfect for updating insurance values after an appraisal, or moving an entire collection to a new storage location.
</Tip>

## Updating Valuations

### Manual Market Value Updates

For items without automatic pricing:

1. Open the item in edit mode
2. Update the **Market Value** field
3. Add a note in the description about the valuation source
4. Save changes

The new value immediately affects:
- Individual item valuation
- Portfolio total value
- Collection values
- Location inventory values

### Insurance Value Updates

Update insurance values when:
- Getting new appraisals
- Coverage amounts change
- Market conditions shift significantly

<Card title="Insurance Value vs Market Value" icon="shield">
  **Insurance Value**: The amount your insurance company agrees to cover

  **Market Value**: Current estimated selling price

  These can differ. Insurance value is often higher to cover replacement costs.
</Card>

### Tracking Value Changes

After updating values, view the impact:
- **Item detail page** shows percentage change from purchase price
- **Valuation history** chart shows value over time
- **Dashboard** reflects new portfolio total
- **Wealth Garden** updates to show growth trends

## Changing Locations

Move items between storage locations:

### Single Item

1. Edit the item
2. Change the **Location** field
3. Save changes

### Multiple Items

1. Use bulk edit to move several items at once
2. Or use the **Move** quick action from the item detail page

<Tip>
Track items you're moving between locations by creating a temporary collection called "In Transit" until they reach their destination.
</Tip>

## Adding to Collections

Organize items by adding them to one or more collections:

1. Edit the item
2. In the **Collections** field, check the collections to add the item to
3. Save changes

An item can belong to multiple collections simultaneously.

**Example**: A vintage Rolex could be in both "Investment Watches" and "Everyday Wear" collections.

Learn more in the [Collections guide](/features/collections).
