description: "Complete guide to asset valuations, pricing methods, and portfolio value tracking in Storehouses"

## Overview

Accurate valuations are essential for insurance, investment tracking, and estate planning. Storehouses uses both automatic pricing for precious metals and manual valuation for other assets to provide real-time portfolio value tracking.

## How Valuations Work

Storehouses supports two valuation methods depending on asset type:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Automatic Pricing" icon="robot">
    **Precious metals** get real-time spot price updates

    Requires: weight, purity, metal type
  </Card>

  <Card title="Manual Valuation" icon="hand">
    **All other assets** use your entered market value

    Requires: periodic manual updates
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Automatic Precious Metals Pricing

### How It Works

For precious metals, Storehouses automatically calculates current value based on:

1. **Spot Price** - Real-time market price per troy ounce
2. **Weight** - Amount of metal in the item
3. **Purity** - Fineness (e.g., .9999 for 24k gold)
4. **Quantity** - Number of identical items

**Formula**:
```
Current Value = Spot Price × Weight × Purity × Quantity
```

### Supported Metals

<ParamField path="Gold" type="automatic">
  Real-time spot pricing in USD per troy ounce
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Silver" type="automatic">
  Real-time spot pricing in USD per troy ounce
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Platinum" type="automatic">
  Real-time spot pricing in USD per troy ounce
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Palladium" type="automatic">
  Real-time spot pricing in USD per troy ounce
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Rhodium" type="automatic">
  Real-time spot pricing in USD per troy ounce
</ParamField>

### Price Update Frequency

- **During market hours**: Every 15 minutes
- **Market closed**: Last available price held until markets reopen
- **Weekends/holidays**: Price frozen until next trading day

<Tip>
Precious metals values update automatically throughout the day. You don't need to manually refresh or update these items.
</Tip>

### Setting Up Automatic Pricing

When adding a precious metal item:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Metal Type">
    Choose gold, silver, platinum, palladium, or rhodium
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter Weight">
    Specify weight and unit (troy oz, grams, kilograms)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter Purity">
    Input fineness (e.g., .999, .9999) or karat for gold
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Quantity">
    Enter number of identical items (default: 1)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save Item">
    Value automatically calculates and updates going forward
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Premium Over Spot

<Warning>
Automatic pricing uses spot prices only. It doesn't account for numismatic premiums, collectible value, or dealer markups.
</Warning>

For rare or collectible precious metal items (e.g., rare coins, limited mintages):

1. Use automatic pricing for **melt value** baseline
2. Add a separate manual item or note for **numismatic premium**
3. Or enter a manual **Market Value** override to include premium

**Example**:
- 1 oz Gold American Eagle
- Automatic value: $2,050 (spot price × 1 oz)
- Actual market value: $2,150 (includes $100 premium)
- Solution: Add $100 to manual market value field

## Manual Market Valuation

### Asset Types Using Manual Valuation

All non-precious-metal assets require manual market value entry:

- Luxury watches
- Gems and jewelry
- Wine and spirits
- Fine art
- Arms and armor
- Other collectibles

### Entering Market Value

<ParamField path="market_value" type="currency">
  Current estimated market value

  **Definition**: Amount you could reasonably sell the item for today

  **Sources**:
  - Recent auction results
  - Dealer quotes
  - Online marketplace prices
  - Professional appraisals
</ParamField>

### When to Update Market Values

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="After Professional Appraisal">
    Update immediately after getting items professionally appraised. Add appraisal date to item notes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Quarterly Reviews">
    For actively traded assets (watches, art), review values quarterly based on current market conditions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Annual Updates">
    At minimum, review and update all values annually, especially for insurance documentation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Market Events">
    Update after significant market events affecting your asset class (e.g., artist retrospective, brand announcement).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Condition Changes">
    Immediately update if item condition changes due to damage, restoration, or wear.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Finding Current Market Values

**For Watches**:
- Chrono24, Bob's Watches, WatchBox
- Recent auction results (Christie's, Sotheby's)
- Authorized dealer quotes

**For Wine & Spirits**:
- Wine-Searcher
- Liv-ex (for fine wines)
- Auction house results
- Specialist retailers

**For Fine Art**:
- Artnet, Artsy, Invaluable
- Gallery quotes
- Recent auction comps
- Professional appraisal

**For Gemstones**:
- GIA price reports
- Rapaport Diamond Report
- Local jeweler appraisals
- Auction comparables

<Tip>
Document your valuation source in the item's description field. This helps with future updates and insurance claims.
</Tip>

## Insurance Value vs Market Value

Storehouses tracks both values because they serve different purposes:

### Market Value

<ParamField path="market_value" type="currency">
  **What it is**: Current fair market selling price

  **Use for**:
  - Portfolio performance tracking
  - Investment decision making
  - Estate valuation
  - Tax reporting (cost basis comparison)

  **Typically**: Lower or equal to insurance value
</ParamField>

### Insurance Value

<ParamField path="insurance_value" type="currency">
  **What it is**: Replacement cost for insurance coverage

  **Use for**:
  - Insurance policy declarations
  - Coverage verification
  - Claims documentation

  **Typically**: Higher to cover replacement costs and premiums
</ParamField>

### How They Differ

**Example: Vintage Rolex Submariner**
- **Market Value**: $15,000 (what it sells for on Chrono24)
- **Insurance Value**: $18,000 (replacement cost including dealer premium, taxes, authentication)

**Why**: Insurance value covers all costs to replace the item, not just raw market price.

<Card title="Best Practice" icon="lightbulb">
  Set insurance value 10-20% higher than market value to account for replacement costs, dealer premiums, and market volatility.
</Card>

## Valuation History Tracking

### Automatic History Records

## Best Practices for Accurate Valuation

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use Conservative Estimates">
    When uncertain, estimate on the conservative side for market value. It's better to be pleasantly surprised than disappointed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Document Valuation Sources">
    Always note where values come from in the item description. Include dates, links, or appraiser names.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Regular Review Schedule">
    Set calendar reminders to review and update valuations quarterly or annually depending on asset type.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Professional Appraisals for High-Value Items">
    Get professional appraisals for items worth $10,000+, especially for insurance purposes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Track Market Conditions">
    Follow your asset classes to understand when values are rising or falling. Update more frequently in volatile markets.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Separate Sentimental from Market Value">
    Track actual market value, not what the item is worth to you personally. Use notes to record sentimental significance.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Account for Condition">
    Be honest about condition when valuing. Excellent condition items command premiums; damaged items sell at discounts.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Compare Multiple Sources">
    Check several comparable sales or price sources before settling on a valuation. Average if there's variation.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
